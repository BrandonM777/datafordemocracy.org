project_descriptions: 
  - Assemble is a Data for Democracy community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. We have several active repositories, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project. 
  - Assemble's sister project Discursive searches Twitter for a collection of topics and stores the Tweet data in an Elasticsearch index and an S3 bucket. The intended use case is for social network composition and Tweet text analysis.
