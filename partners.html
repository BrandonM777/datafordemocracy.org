      <h3>Partnerships</h3>
      <p>At Data for Democracy, we believe in the mantra "teamwork makes the dream work," and we actively work with new partners outside of our community to build stronger teams driven by the desire to solve hard problems. These partnerships keep the energy flowing in our volunteers, and help to support our goal of putting the right skillsets against the right problems.</p>

      <h4>Who We Partner With</h4>
      <p>Our partnerships run the gamut from government agencies to private organizations. For instance, we have one group working closely with the City of Boston to help develop a model aimed at <a href="https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling"> predicting car crashes</a> while another team is working with ProPublica <a href="https://github.com/Data4Democracy/house_expenditures">analyzing congressional spending</a>.</p>
      <p>We're not short on desire to work on interesting projects, so if you have a problem to solve or a question to answer - <a href="/contact.html"> contact us</a> for more info!</p>

      <h4>What We Partner On</h4>
      <p>In short - really cool problems and ideas. We love to hear any and all opportunities that we can lend support on. Mentioned above, we're currently building models to predict car accidents while simultaneously analyzing congressional spending. But that's not even close to everything we are working on! For instance:</p>

      * Building tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics.<br>
      * Aggregating and normalizing county-level election results to model and understand any potential anomalies.<br>
      * Analyzing the distribution of Medicare prescription drug coverage and where tax dollars are going.<br>
      * Building a USA dashboard to display key performance indicators - with a first run focus on crime statistics.<br>
      * Classifying, tagging, analyzing and visualizing news events about internal displacement.<br><br>

	<h4> Why We Partner</h4>

	<p>As a community of like-minded data scientists and technologists, we are constantly looking for creative ways to apply our trade. So, on the one hand, we look to partnerships as a way to do just that. On the other hand, we want to make a change both wherever and however we can! Partnerships direct our abilities in a way that allow us to work toward making that change, and ensure that the work we are doing is valuable and important!</p>

	<h4> How We Partner</h4>

<p>Collaboratively! We want to work closely with our Partners to ensure that the work done is the work needed. We also understand that our Partners are extremely knowlegeable about the problems that they need solved, and that insight is crucial in understand how we need to work to help solve them.</p>

<p>For each project, we assign a leadership within Data for Democracy that identifies one or more analysts as Leads for each project. These Leads will work closely to understand our Partner's needs, and will communicate those needs in the form of tasks required to the broader team. Facilitators will work with these Leads to create a feedback loop with the Partner and make sure communication flows smoothly. </p>

<p>We also encourage our Partners to be active members in our Slack instance - especially in the channels specific to their project! This keeps the progress of work communicate in a passive fashion, and allows our Partners to check in and provide feedback wherever (and whenever) they feel is necessary.

      <p>If you have a problem that you want solved - let us know! We would love the chance to talk to you about it, and see how we can help you and your team!</p>
