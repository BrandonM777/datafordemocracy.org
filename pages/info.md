Data for Democracy is a community of data people volunteering on social impact projects.

### Our Mission
To be an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists to volunteer and collaborate on projects that make a positive impact on society.

### Our Story
In December 2016 we started an experiment. We wanted to see what would happen if like-minded people from around the world gathered to work on technology that has an impact. As of the end of January 2017, our community has grown to 444 volunteers working on (how many?) projects.
