Data For Democracy looks for projects that have a strong collaborative nature, and leverage data and technology to create positive social impact.

We engage in a mix of:
1) Community-led projects, which are proposed and self-organized by Data For Democracy members. Most of our current projects fall into this category.
2) Partner-led projects, which involve more formal collaboration with city governments and local and international NGOs.

If you'd like to get involved, Data For Democracy offers a variety of opportunities to suit all levels of commitment, skill, and experience. We welcome first-timers, and are keen to support them in their learning.
Volunteering at Data For Democracy can entail anything from hanging out in Slack discussing ideas, to contributing periodic code commits, to leading a project of your own. Depending on your comfort level, you can contribute as intensively or as casually as you like!
